# Is a surf and ice cream shop bussiness sustainable year long?

## Purpose of our analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop bussiness is sustainable all year long. We did this through retrieving all the temperatures for the month of June and December from the database. Also, we further created a summary statistics showing the count, minimum temperature, max temperature etc for the two months to further understand how big of a role weather has in the success of our surf and ice cream shop bussiness

### Discoveries of our analysis

## The month of June and December
- The total count of June Temps in the database was 1700. The total count of December Temps in the database was 1517. There was more data available for the month of June 
- The minimum temperature of the two months are quite far apart. The minimum temperature of the month of June is 64. The minimum temprature for the month of December is 56
- Also we notice that with a lower count of data for the month of December, it still had a standard deviation of 3.75 which was greater than the standard deviation of 3.26 for the month of June

## Conclusions from our results
- It is quite clear that there was more data avalaible and used for our analysis for the month of June. From this we can conclude that the summary statistics for the month of December can change a lot if we had the same number of data available for the month compared to the month of the June. Also, our primary objective was to determine whether the surf and ice cream bussiness will be sustainable all year long. We can not make a clear conclusion on the fate of the surf and ice cream shop by comparing data where the total count of data for the two months is not the same
- We further learned that the minimum temperature has a large variation between the two months. In December the minimum temperature is 56. Knowing how much the success of the bussiness depends on great weather, we can conclude that the bussiness will not do well in such temperature. Also to add to that, if we had more data available for December it's quite possible that the minimum temperature could potentially be even lower for the month of December. Again, this adds to flawed conclusions from our analysis
- Thirdly, we also learned that the standard deviation which is the variation from the mean is higher for the month of December than the month of June. This is startling since we  don't have enough data for the month of December. If the count of Temps was equal between the two months, it's possbile that the standard deviation could be even higher for December than it already is. It's also possible it could be lower than what it currently is. Once again due to not having enough data for the month of December, it's tough to make a clear legitimate conclusion whether the bussiness will be sustainable all year long.
